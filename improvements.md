# Potential Improvements


## 1. Search and Filtering

We can add a search bar and filtering options (e.g., by date, category, or tags) to the sidebar for easier navigation.

**Reason?:**
 Improves usability by allowing users to quickly find specific articles.

**Implementation:**

- Add a search input field in the sidebar.

- Implement filtering logic in ArticlesList.tsx to filter articles based on the search query.

## Pagination or Infinite Scroll

We can implement pagination or infinite scroll for the article list to handle large datasets.

**Reason?:**
Ensures the application remains performant when dealing with a large number of articles.

**Implementation:**
Can use a pagination library (e.g., react-paginate) 


## Real API Integration

##### Replace mock data with real API calls to fetch articles dynamically. To makes the application production-ready and capable of handling real-world data.

**Implementation:** 
- Update fetchArticles in api.js to call a real API endpoint.

- Add error handling and loading states for a better user experience.

*Although currently its implemented in a way, can be easily replace with the API endpoint in future*

## Unit and Integration Tests

We should add unit tests for components and integration tests for API calls. To ensures code reliability and prevents regressions.

**Implementation:**

- Can be uses testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

- Write tests for critical components like ArticlesList, ArticleCard, and MinimalChart.

## Performance Optimization

Optimize the application for faster load times and smoother interactions. To improves user experience, especially on slower devices or networks.

**Implementation:**
- Lazy load components using React.lazy and Suspense.

- Optimize images and charts for performance.

## Accessibility Improvements

Ensure the application is fully accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. To make the application inclusive and compliant with accessibility standards.

## Analytics Integration
Track user interactions and article views using analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel. To provides insights into user behavior and helps improve the application.

**We can suggest a Roadmap with the prioritisation of these items, such as Core Features, Enhanced functionality and optimisation.**
